What is FCP?

First Contentful Paint is a browser performance metric that measures:

How long it takes for the browser to render the first piece of content on the screen
(text, image, canvas, SVG — anything visible)

It tells you when users first see something happening on the page.

=========================================================

CLS measures visual stability — whether page elements move around while loading.

The AutomationExercise website loads in a very static way (no dynamic content shifting like ads, lazy-loaded images, etc.). So if there is no layout shift, then CLS will naturally be 0.

This is normal and expected behavior — not an issue in your test.
===========================================
✅ FID — First Input Delay

What it means:
FID measures how quickly the page responds when a user first interacts (click, tap, press key).

Time between the user's first action and the browser's response starting.

Example: You click a button — if the page is busy loading scripts, your click may lag.

Good FID: < 100ms
High FID = page is blocked by heavy JavaScript

========================================================

✅ INP — Interaction to Next Paint

What it means:
INP measures the responsiveness of all user interactions during the page visit, not just the first one, and reports the worst/slowest interaction.

Time between any user action and the visual update on screen.

INP is replacing FID as the main responsiveness metric.

Good INP: < 200ms

Think of it as: A better, modern metric for page interactivity than FID.

======================================================================

✅ LCP — Largest Contentful Paint

What it means:
LCP measures how long it takes to load the largest visible element on screen (big banner, hero image, heading text, etc).

When the main visible content finishes loading.

This is a core UX metric — users feel the site is ready when LCP completes.

Good LCP: < 2.5 seconds
